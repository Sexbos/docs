# Configuring your repository

Once you've [added your first repository](codacy-quickstart.md), **it's important that you configure it** for your use case and preferences. An optimal configuration integrates code analysis seamlessly into your development pipeline while avoiding false positives. This encourages your team to adopt and commit to best practices.

To configure your repository, follow these steps:

1.  [Ignoring files](#ignoring-files)
1.  [Configuring tools and code patterns](#configuring-code-patterns)
1.  [Adding coverage reports](#adding-coverage-reports) (optional)

## 1. Ignoring files {: id="ignoring-files"}

[Ignore files](../repositories-configure/ignoring-files.md) to prevent Codacy from analyzing compiled code, third-party libraries, and any arbitrary collection of files and directories.

## 2. Configuring code patterns {: id="configuring-code-patterns"}

[Configure code patterns](../repositories-configure/configuring-code-patterns.md) to adapt the analysis tools to your use case, leverage existing configuration files, and filter flagged issues.

!!! tip
    To ensure that multiple repositories consistently follow the same global tool and code pattern configurations, [use an organization coding standard](../organizations/using-a-coding-standard.md) instead.

## 3. Adding coverage reports {: id="adding-coverage-reports"}

[Add coverage reports to Codacy](../coverage-reporter/index.md) to detail how much of your code is covered by tests and unify your quality and coverage pipelines. You can generate coverage reports locally and upload them to Codacy picking from a range of options: CI/CD integration, CLI, Docker, GitHub action, and more.

## Next steps {: id="next-steps"}

Once youâ€™re satisfied with your setup, [integrate Codacy with your Git workflow](integrating-codacy-with-your-git-workflow.md) to flag potential issues, block problematic pull requests, and display other useful suggestions directly on your Git provider.

!!! tip
    To showcase the current code quality grade and coverage, [add a Codacy badge to your repository](adding-a-codacy-badge.md).
