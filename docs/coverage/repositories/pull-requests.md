# [Coverage] Pull Requests page
<!--TODO
    Review page, see https://codacy.atlassian.net/browse/COV-119 for more details-->

The **Pull Requests page** displays an overview of the pull requests in your repository, such as the analysis status and coverage metrics for each pull request. This allows you to monitor the coverage of the work in progress in your repository.

By default, the page lists open pull requests but you can click the **Closed** tab at the top of the list to display the closed pull requests.
